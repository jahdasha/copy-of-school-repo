#Pangram Checker


## Do
A pangram is a sentence that contains all the letters of the English alphabet at least once, for example: `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.`

Write a function that takes a string and determines whether or not a string is a pangram, **without** typing out the full alphabet anywhere in your code.


* Bonus
  * Handle punctuation in the sentence.


  put string in an array

  create another array that will hold all different char

  for the length of the array check to see if the selected letter is different from the other letter of that array.
   - if it is different push into other array for different char

  check if array of different char is equal to 26
  	- if is less than it does not use all of the letters
