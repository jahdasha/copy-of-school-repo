- go through each card
- assign number or letter and suit
- create four arrays for suits
- check each array to see if they equal 13
- the array that is less than 13 is the array that you will test
- check each card to see if it pairs with the expected number or letter
- if the expected number does not have a pair then that is the card that is missing
